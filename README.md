#Golang-multi-stage-docker-build

Using a multi-stage build in Docker, we've created an efficient and lightweight container for our Go-based calculator application. By leveraging the strengths of Go's static compilation and scratch images, we've achieved a significant reduction in image size, making it a great approach for building and deploying small and efficient containerized applications.
